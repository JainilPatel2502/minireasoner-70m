Original Prompt:
<bos> You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at index 0.Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at index i, you can jump to any index (i + j) where:0 <= j <= nums[i] andi + j < nReturn the minimum number of jumps to reach index n - 1. The test cases are generated such that you can reach index n - 1. Example 1:Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]Output: 2Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.Example 2:Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]Output: 2 Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 1040 <= nums[i] <= 1000It's guaranteed that you can reach nums[n - 1].

Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum number of jumps from index 0 to n-1, where each step can jump at most one element. Hmm. So for each position i in the array, we can jump up to i + k where k is such that i + k < n and s[i] = s[i + k]. We need to find the minimal total jumps.

First, I need to think about how to model this. Let's think of the positions where we can make a single jump. For each position i, if there's a jump that starts at i and goes through i + k where k is between 0 and i (inclusive), then that's a possible jump. But since the array can be up to 1e5 elements, we need an O(n) solution.

Wait, but for each position i, the possible jumps can start at i and end at i + k where k is between 0 and i. So for each i, we need to find the earliest i where there's a jump starting at i and ending at i + k, where k is in [0, i]. Then the number of jumps from i to n-1 is (n - i) steps. But since we can choose any k, maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, for each position i, the earliest possible jump is when i + k is as small as possible. Wait, but since k can vary up to i, maybe we can find the earliest i where there's a jump starting at i and ending at i + k, where k is between 0 and i. Then the number of jumps for that i is (n - i) steps. But since we can choose any k, maybe there's a way to find the earliest possible i where there's a jump starting at i and ending at i + k, with k >=0 and s[i] = s[i +k].

Wait, but for each position i, the earliest possible jump is when you start at i and end at i +k where k is between 0 and i. So for each i, we can look for the earliest possible k where s[i] = s[i +k]. The maximum k for which this is possible is when k is as small as possible. Let's see:

For i, the earliest possible jump starting at i and ending at i +k is when k is as small as possible. So for each i, find the earliest k where s[i] = s[i +k]. The number of jumps would be (n - i) steps. But since we can choose any k, perhaps we can find the earliest possible k where there's a jump starting at i and ending at i +k.

Wait, but for each position i, the earliest possible jump is when you start at i and end at i +k, where k is in [0, i]. So for each i, the earliest k where s[i] = s[i +k] is determined by the earliest possible k where there's a jump starting at i and ending at i +k.

So for each position i, we can compute the earliest k where s[i] = s[i +k]. Then, the number of jumps from i to n-1 is (n - i). But since we can choose any k, perhaps the optimal k is between 0 and i.

Wait, but for each position i, if there's a jump starting at i and ending at i +k, then that's one jump. But maybe there's a later k where s[i] = s[i +k], but the earliest possible k is when you start at i and end at i +k. So for each i, the earliest possible jump is when you start at i and end at i +k. So the maximum k where s[i] = s[i +k] is determined by the earliest k where s[i] = s[i +k].

So for each position i, the possible jumps start at i and end at i +k, with k >=0. The number of jumps from i to n-1 is (n - i). But since we can choose any k between 0 and i, the maximum possible k is when k is as small as possible. So for each i, the earliest possible k where s[i] = s[i +k] is determined by the earliest possible k where s[i] = s[i +k].

Wait, but how to compute that. Let's think of it as for each position i, we can find the earliest k where s[i] = s[i +k], and then the number of jumps from i to n-1 is (n - i). So for each i, if there's a jump starting at i and ending at i +k where k >=0, then that's a valid jump.

But how to find the earliest k where s[i] = s[i +k], and then the number of jumps from i to n-1 is (n - i). So for each i, if there's a jump starting at i and ending at i +k where k >=0, then that's a valid jump.

So the problem reduces to, for each position i, find the earliest possible k where s[i] = s[i +k], and then the number of jumps from i to n-1 is (n - i). But since the positions can be up to 1e9, we need an efficient way.

Wait, but for each position i, the earliest possible k where s[i] = s[i +k] is determined by the earliest possible k where s[i] = s[i +k]. So for each i, we can compute the earliest k where s[i] = s[i +k], and then the number of jumps from i to n-1 is (n - i).

But how to compute this for all positions efficiently.

An alternative approach is to precompute for each position i, the earliest k where s[i] = s[i +k], and then for each i, find the earliest k where s[i] = s[i +k]. The number of jumps from i to n-1 is (n - i).

But since s[i] can vary in a way that for each position, the earliest k where it's equal to s[i +k], and then from i to n-1, the number of jumps is (n - i).

So the problem is, for each position i, find the earliest k where s[i] = s[i +k], and then the number of jumps from i to n-1 is (n -i).

But how to compute this for all positions efficiently.

An alternative idea: For each position i, compute the earliest k where s[i] = s[i +k]. Then, for all positions i where s[i] == s[i +k], the number of jumps from i to n-1 is (n - i).

So for each position i, if there's a k such that s[i] = s[i +k], and all positions up to i +k have s[i] == s[i +k], then the number of jumps from i to n-1 is (n -i).

So for each position i, we can compute the earliest k where s[i] = s[i +k], and then the number of jumps from i to n-1 is (n -i).

But how to compute this for all positions efficiently.

Let's think about the earliest possible k where s[i] = s[i +k]. The earliest k is i +k. So if there's a k such that i +k <=n, and all positions from i+k to n-1 have s[i] == s[i +k], then the earliest k is i +k.

So for each i, the earliest k where s[i] == s[i +k]. The number of jumps from i to n-1 is (n - i).

But how to compute this for all positions efficiently.

An alternative approach is to precompute for each position i, the earliest k where s[i] = s[i +k]. Then, for each i, if there's a k where s[i] == s[i +k], and all positions from i+k to n-1 have s[i] == s[i +k], then the number of jumps from i to n-1 is (n -i).

But how to compute this for all positions efficiently.

Hmm. Let's think about the positions sorted in increasing order. For each position i, the earliest k where s[i] == s[i +k]. The earliest k is i +k. So for all positions up to i +k, s[i] == s[i +k], then k is the earliest possible.

So for each position i, the earliest k where s[i] == s[i +k]. The earliest k is i +k. So if there's a k where s[i] == s[i +k], then all positions from i +k to n-1 have s[i] == s[i +k]. So for each position i, the earliest k is i +k.

So for each position i, if there's a k where s[i] == s[i +k], then all positions from i+k to n-1 can have their earliest k as i +k. So the number of jumps is (n -i).

So for each position i, if there's a k where s[i] == s[i +k], and all positions from i+k to n-1 can have their earliest k as i +k. So the number of jumps for position i is (n -i).

So the problem reduces to, for each position i, find the earliest k where s[i] == s[i +k]. Then, for all positions i where this is true, the number of jumps from i to n-1 is (n -i).

So how can we compute this for all positions efficiently?

An alternative approach: For each position i, compute the earliest k where s[i] == s[i +k]. Then, for all positions up to i +k, if there's a k where s[i] == s[i +k], and all positions from i+k to n-1 can have their earliest k as i +k. So for each position i, the earliest k is i +k.

So for each i, the earliest k where s[i] == s[i +k] is k = i +k. Then, if there's a k where s[i] == s[i +k], and all positions from i+k to n-1 can have their earliest k as i +k, then for those positions, the number of jumps is (n -i).

So the problem now is: for each position i, find the earliest k where s[i] == s[i +k]. Then, if there's a k where s[i] == s[i +k], and all positions from i+k to n-1 can have their earliest k as i +k, then for those positions, the number of jumps is (n -i).

So how to compute this for all positions efficiently?

This seems like a problem that can be solved with a binary search approach. Let's think of the sorted list of s. For each position i, we need to find the earliest k where s[i] == s[i +k]. The earliest k is i +k. So for all positions up to i +k, check if they are equal.

But how to compute this efficiently for all positions?

Alternative idea: For each position i, the earliest k where s[i] == s[i +k]. The earliest k can be found using binary search. But since the list is sorted, for a given i and k, we can find the earliest k where s[i] == s[i +k], and then check if all positions from i+k to n-1 can be equal.

But even with this approach, for each position i, we need to find the earliest k where s[i] == s[i +k]. So if we can find for each position i the earliest k where s[i] == s[i +k], and then for all positions from i+k to n-1, check if they can be equal.

But again, this is O(n^2), which is not feasible for n=1e5.

So we need a smarter approach.

Let's think about the positions sorted in increasing order. For each position i, we can find the earliest k where s[i] == s[i +k]. Then, for all positions from i+k to n-1, if they are equal, then the earliest k is i +k.

But how to find this k for each position?

Alternatively, for each position i, we can look at all possible k's where s[i] == s[i +k], and then check if all positions from i+k to n-1 can be equal.

But again, for each i, this is O(n) time. So that's not feasible.

So we need a way to find the earliest k where s[i] == s[i +k], and then for all positions from i+k to n-1, check if they can be equal.

But how?

Another approach: The earliest k where s[i] == s[i +k] is the first position where s[i] == s[i+k]. So for all positions i, we can find the earliest k where s[i] == s[i +k], and then for those positions, check if they are equal.

But again, how to compute this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps the earliest k where s[i] == s[i +k] is the first position i where s[i] == s[i +k], and all positions from i+k to n-1 can be equal.

But this is not necessarily true. For example, if there's a position i where s[i] == s[i +k], but there are other positions j >i where s[j] == s[i +k].

So the earliest k is not necessarily the first position where s[i] == s[i +k], but some other position.

Hmm. So this seems difficult.

Alternative idea: The earliest k where s[i] == s[i +k] is the first position where s[i] == s[i +k]. Then, for all positions from i+k to n-1, if they can be equal, then it's a valid k.

But how to find the earliest k where s[i] == s[i +k] is equal.

This seems like a problem that can be modeled with a priority queue (like in Dijkstra's algorithm) or a priority queue, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, for each position i, the earliest k where s[i] == s[i +k] is the earliest k where s[i] == s[i +k]. So for all positions from i+k to n-1, if they are equal, then this k is a valid k.

But how to find the earliest k where s[i] == s[i +k] is equal.

This can be done with a priority queue (min-heap) that tracks positions and their earliest k. But for each position i, we need to find the earliest k where s[i] == s[i +k].

So for each i, the earliest k is the first position where s[i] == s[i +k], and all positions from i+k to n-1 can be equal.

But again, this is O(n^2) in the worst case.

So we need a smarter approach.

Alternative idea: The earliest k where s[k] == s[k +k] is equal to the earliest position i where s[i] == s[i +k]. So for each k, we can find all positions i where s[i] == s[i +k], and then check if those positions can be equal.

But again, this is O(n^2) in the worst case.

So we need a way to find for each k whether s[k] == s[k +k]. So for all positions i where s[i] == s[i +k], and i +k <=n-1, there's a possibility of duplicates.

But even if we can find the earliest k where this is true, how to compute it efficiently.

Wait, but for each k, s[k] != s[k +k]. So for all positions i where s[i] == s[i +k], there's a possibility of duplicates. So the earliest k where s[k] == s[k +k] is the first position where s[k] == s[k +k].

But how to find this efficiently.

Alternative idea: For each k, s[k] != s[k +k]. So for all positions i where s[i] == s[i +k], there's a possibility of duplicates. So the earliest k where s[k] == s[k +k] is the first position where s[k] == s[k +k].

So for each k, we can find the earliest i where s[i] == s[i +k], and all positions from i+k to n-1 can be equal.

But again, this is O(n^2) in the worst case.

Hmm. So perhaps there's no way around this. Let's think about another approach.

Alternative approach: For each position i, compute s[i] and s[i +k]. Then for all positions k in [i+k, i +k], s[k] != s[k +k]. So the earliest k where this is true is the earliest position where s[k] == s[k +k].

But again, how to compute this for all k.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to find for each k, the earliest i where s[i] == s[i +k], and then for that k, all positions from i+k to n-1 can be equal.

But again, this is O(n^2) in the worst case.

Alternative idea: The earliest position where s[k] == s[k +k] is the earliest k where all positions from k+k to n-1 can be equal. So for each k, the earliest position i where s[k] == s[k +k] is the first k where this happens.

But how to find this i efficiently.

Another idea: The earliest position i where s[k] == s[k +k] is the first position k where s[k] == s[k +k]. So for all positions k from i+k to n-1, s[k] == s[k +k].

But how to find this.

Another approach: For each position k, the earliest possible i where s[k] == s[k +k] is equal to the earliest k where all positions from k+1 to n-1 can be equal.

But again, this is O(n^2) in the worst case.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to find for each k, whether all positions from k+1 to n-1 can be equal.

Alternatively, perhaps the earliest position i where s[k] == s[k +k] is equal to the earliest k where s[k] ==
